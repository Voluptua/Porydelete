# About

Porydelete is a CLI tool which allows you to delete specific parts of the 3.gen decomp projects such as Pokemon, Items, Maps, Tilesets, Events and more. This is a project inspired by the `strip_events.py` script on my [pret-decomp-resources](https://github.com/Voluptua/pret-decomp-resources) repository. 

I am working on this project because:
  - I am not good at coding with Rust and I want to get better using this language
  - I always wanted to create a romhacking Tool (even in the binary hacking times)
  - I am also working on my own romhack and I want to save storage by removing unused content in the final product such as unused Items or Pokemon


# State of development

Since I JUST created this repository and havnt pushed to it yet, its quite obvious that there isnt a stable release yet but I am more than motivated to create this tool! 

# Getting started

Follow these instructions to build this project: [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/Voluptua/Porydelete/blob/main/INSTALL.md)

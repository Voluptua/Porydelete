# Building

The latest version of Rust is mandatory for building this project.

Execute the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/Voluptua/porydelete
cd porydelete/
cargo build --release
```

If running the `cargo build --release` command doesn't work or you get an error, try updating Rust and then proceed.

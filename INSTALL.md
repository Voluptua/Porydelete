Before we jump into the installation/building process, you need to have Rust installed. I am not going over how to install Rust.

# Building

Follow:

```
git clone https://github.com/Voluptua/porydelete
cd porydelete/
cargo build --release
```

If running the `cargo build --release` command doesn't work or you get an error, try updating Rust and then proceed. Otherwise, you can just install one of the stable releases. 
They are available for Windows and Linux.

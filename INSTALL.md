Before we jump into the installation/building process, you need to have Rust installed.

# Building

Follow:

```
git clone https://github.com/Voluptua/Porydelete
cd Porydelete/
cargo build
```

If running the `cargo build` command doesnt work or you get an error, try updating Rust and then proceed. Otherwise, you can just install one of the stable releases.
